    "Question13: What&#39;s the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The main differences between tuples and lists in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mutability:**\n",
    "   - Lists are mutable, which means you can change their elements (add, remove, or modify) after they are created.\n",
    "   - Tuples are immutable, which means once you create a tuple, you cannot change its elements. You can't add, remove, or modify elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Syntax:**\n",
    "   - Lists are enclosed in square brackets, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`.\n",
    "   - Tuples are enclosed in parentheses, e.g., `(1, 2, 3)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Performance:**\n",
    "   - Lists are generally slightly slower than tuples because of their mutability.\n",
    "   - Tuples are faster and use less memory because of their immutability.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use Case:**\n",
    "   - Lists are typically used when you have a collection of items that may change over time.\n",
    "   - Tuples are used when you want to create a collection of items that should not change during the program's execution, such as coordinates or keys in a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, lists are mutable, enclosed in square brackets, and used for collections of items that can change. Tuples are immutable, enclosed in parentheses, and used for collections of items that should remain constant."

In Python, variables are references to objects in memory, and when you assign a list to a variable, the variable stores a reference to the memory location where the list is stored.

    "1. `copy.copy()` (Shallow Copy):\r\n",

    "2. `copy.deepcopy()` (Deep Copy):\r\n",
    "   - It creates a new object that is a deep copy of the original object.\r\n",

    "   - Changes to objects within the copied structure will not affect the original structure, and vice versa.\r\n",
