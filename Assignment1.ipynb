    "1. Integer (int):\r\n",
    "   - An integer is a data type that represents whole numbers, both positive and negative, without any decimal or fractional part.\r\n",

    "\r\n",

    "   - A floating-point data type, often referred to as a \"float,\" is used to represent numbers with decimal points or fractions.\r\n",
    "   - Examples of floating-point numbers include 3.14, -0.5, 2.71828, and 123.456.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. Boolean (bool):\r\n",
    "   - A boolean data type can have one of two values: true or false. It is used for representing binary or logical values.\r\n",
    "   - Booleans are frequently used in conditional statements and logical operations.\r\n",
    "   - Examples include `True` and `False`, which are often used in programming to make decisions based on conditions."
