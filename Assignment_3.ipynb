    "Question1: Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Functions are advantageous in programs because they:\r\n",
    "- Promote code reusability.\r\n",
    "- Simplify complex tasks by breaking them into manageable parts.\r\n",
    "- Enhance code organization and readability.\r\n",
    "- Enable easier debugging and maintenance.\r\n",
    "- Facilitate collaboration by dividing work among team members.\r\n",
    "- Promote a modular and structured approach to programming."

    "\n",
    "Answer: The code in a function runs when the function is called, not when it's specified or defined. Functions are like reusable blocks of code that execute their instructions when invoked or called from other parts of the program."

    "\n",
    "Answer: The main difference between a function and a function call is their purpose and usage:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Function:** A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task or set of tasks. It defines a series of instructions that can be executed when the function is called.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Function Call:** A function call is the actual execution of a function in your code. It invokes the function and executes the instructions defined within it. When you call a function, you provide any required arguments, and the function processes them and may return a result.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In summary, a function is a defined piece of code, while a function call is the action of executing that code by invoking the function with specific arguments (if needed)."

    "Question5: How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: In a Python program, there is one global scope and potentially multiple local scopes.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Global Scope:** There is only one global scope in a Python program, which includes variables and functions defined at the top level of the program or module. This scope is accessible throughout the entire program.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Local Scopes:** Local scopes are created within functions and exist only while the function is being executed. Each time you call a function, a new local scope is created. If a variable is defined within a function, it is typically considered local to that function and not accessible outside of it. However, global variables can also be accessed from within functions.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "So, the number of local scopes can vary depending on how many functions are called during the execution of your program, while there is always one global scope."

    "Question6: What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: When a function call returns in Python, the variables that were defined within the local scope of that function cease to exist. These local variables are \"destroyed\" or \"garbage-collected,\" and their values are no longer accessible once the function's execution is complete. This means that variables defined inside a function are typically temporary and only exist for the duration of the function call."

    "Answer: If a function in Python does not have a `return` statement, the return value of a call to that function is `None`. In Python, `None` represents the absence of a value or a null value, and it is automatically returned when a function lacks an explicit `return` statement or when the `return` statement is without an expression.\n",

    "Question9: How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: To make a function variable refer to the global variable with the same name, use the `global` keyword before the variable name within the function. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "global_variable = 42\n",
