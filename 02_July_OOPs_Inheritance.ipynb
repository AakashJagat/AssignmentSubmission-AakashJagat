    "## Question2. Discuss the concept of single inheritance and multiple inheritance, highlighting their\n",
    "differences and advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly! In Python, inheritance can be of two main types: single inheritance and multiple inheritance.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Single Inheritance:\r\n",
    "- Single inheritance refers to the scenario where a class inherits from only one parent class.\r\n",
    "- It forms a linear hierarchy where a derived class (child) inherits from a single base class (parent).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Let's illustrate single inheritance in Python:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "# Parent class (Base class)\r\n",
    "class Vehicle:\r\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\r\n",
    "        self.name = name\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "    def start_engine(self):\r\n",
    "        return f\"The {self.name} engine has started.\"\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "# Child class inheriting from Vehicle\r\n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):\r\n",
    "    def drive(self):\r\n",
    "        return f\"Driving the {self.name}.\"\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "# Creating an instance of the Car class\r\n",
    "car = Car(\"Car\")\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "# Accessing attributes and methods from both classes\r\n",
    "print(car.start_engine())  # Inherited from Vehicle\r\n",
    "print(car.drive())  # Defined in the Car class\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Multiple Inheritance:\r\n",
    "- Multiple inheritance refers to the scenario where a class can inherit from more than one base class, thereby inheriting attributes and methods from all parent classes.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "An example of multiple inheritance in Python:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "# First parent class\r\n",
    "class A:\r\n",
    "    def method_a(self):\r\n",
    "        return \"Method A from class A\"\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "# Second parent class\r\n",
    "class B:\r\n",
    "    def method_b(self):\r\n",
    "        return \"Method B from class B\"\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "# Child class inheriting from both A and B\r\n",
    "class C(A, B):\r\n",
    "    def method_c(self):\r\n",
    "        return \"Method C from class C\"\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "# Creating an instance of the child class\r\n",
    "obj_c = C()\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "# Accessing methods from both parent classes\r\n",
    "print(obj_c.method_a())  # Method from class A\r\n",
    "print(obj_c.method_b())  # Method from class B\r\n",
    "print(obj_c.method_c())  # Method from class C\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Differences and Advantages:\r\n",
    "- **Single Inheritance**: It simplifies the class hierarchy, leading to clearer code organization. It's often easier to understand and maintain. However, it restricts a class to inherit from only one parent class.\r\n",
    "- **Multiple Inheritance**: It allows a class to inherit from multiple parent classes, enabling greater code reuse and combining functionalities. However, it can lead to complex hierarchies and potential ambiguity if the same method or attribute is present in multiple parent classes.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The choice between single and multiple inheritance depends on the design and requirements of the system. Single inheritance provides simplicity and clarity, while multiple inheritance offers greater reusability but demands careful design to avoid conflicts in method and attribute names from different parent classes."

    "## Question3. Explain the terms \"base class\" and \"derived class\" in the context of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Answer: \n",
    "In the context of inheritance in object-oriented programming, the terms \"base class\" and \"derived class\" refer to the classes involved in the inheritance relationship.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Base Class (Parent Class):** The base class, also known as the parent class or superclass, is the class whose attributes and methods are inherited by another class. It serves as the foundation or starting point for other classes to inherit from. The base class doesn't inherit from any other class.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Example:\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "class Animal:  # Base Class\r\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\r\n",
    "        print(\"Some generic sound\")\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):  # Dog is a derived class inheriting from Animal\r\n",
    "    def bark(self):\r\n",
    "        print(\"Woof!\")\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In this example, `Animal` is the base class, providing a generic `make_sound` method, and `Dog` is the derived class inheriting from `Animal`.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Derived Class (Child Class):** The derived class, also known as the child class or subclass, is a class that inherits attributes and methods from a base class. It extends or specializes the behavior of the base class by adding new attributes or methods or by overriding existing methods.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Example:\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "class Animal:  # Base Class\r\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\r\n",
    "        print(\"Some generic sound\")\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):  # Dog is a derived class inheriting from Animal\r\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):  # Overriding the make_sound method\r\n",
    "        print(\"Woof!\")\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In this example, `Dog` is the derived class that inherits the `make_sound` method from the `Animal` base class but provides its own specialized implementation of the method.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The base class provides a set of common features that can be shared by multiple derived classes, while each derived class can further specialize and extend the functionality inherited from the base class, leading to a hierarchy of classes in an inheritance relationship."

    "## Question4. What is the significance of the \"protected\" access modifier in inheritance? How does it differ from \"private\" and \"public\" modifiers?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Answer:\n",
    "In Python, there's no strict enforcement of access control like other programming languages, but there are conventions and certain patterns that serve similar purposes to access modifiers in other languages.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Public, Protected, and Private:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. **Public**: By default, in Python, all attributes and methods are public. They can be accessed from inside or outside the class.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Protected**: In Python, a single underscore (_) prefix before an attribute or method name is a convention indicating that it's protected. This doesn't restrict access; however, it serves as an indicator that the attribute or method should be considered protected and should not be accessed directly from outside the class. It is a convention to communicate to other developers that the attribute is intended for internal use or for derived classes.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **Private**: In Python, a double underscore (__) prefix before an attribute or method name is used to make it private. This effectively mangles the attribute or method name, making it harder to access from outside the class. However, it's not truly private, as Python does name mangling, making the attribute or method still accessible through a mangled name from outside the class.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Significance in Inheritance:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Public members**: Inherited by the derived class and can be accessed directly.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Protected members**: Intended to be used by derived classes. Although they can still be accessed from outside the class, it's a signal that they're meant for derived classes and not for general use.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Private members**: Name-mangled to prevent accidental access. Not inherited by the derived class. These members are intended to be used only within the defining class.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Differences:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Public**: Accessible from anywhere.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Protected**: Conventional way to indicate internal usage, suggesting it should not be accessed outside of the class or its subclasses, although it's still accessible.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Private**: Intended for internal use within the class only. Name-mangling is performed to make them harder to access directly from outside the class.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The significance of these access modifiers in inheritance lies in communication: they help indicate the intended usage and accessibility of attributes and methods, even though there's no strict enforcement of access control in Python."
