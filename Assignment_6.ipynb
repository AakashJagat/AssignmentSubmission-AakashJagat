    "Question2. What are the rules to create variables in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: In Python, variables are created and used following these rules:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.\r\n",
    "2. Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).\r\n",
    "3. Variable names are case-sensitive (e.g., `myVar` and `myvar` are different variables).\r\n",
    "4. Python keywords (reserved words) cannot be used as variable names.\r\n",
    "5. Variable names should be descriptive and follow a naming convention (e.g., snake_case for regular variables and CamelCase for classes).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Here's an example of valid variable names:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "my_variable = 42\r\n",
    "user_name = \"John\"\r\n",
    "myList = [1, 2, 3]\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "And here are some examples of invalid variable names:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "1variable = \"Invalid\"  # Starts with a number\r\n",
    "my-variable = 10       # Contains a hyphen\r\n",
    "for = 5                # Uses a Python keyword as a variable name\r\n",

    "Qustion3 What are the standards and conventions followed for the nomenclature of variables in\n",
    "python to improve code readability and maintainability?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: In Python, the following naming conventions are commonly followed to improve code readability and maintainability:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Snake Case**: Use lowercase letters with underscores to separate words in variable names (e.g., `my_variable`, `user_name`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Camel Case**: Use initial lowercase letters for the first word and capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word (e.g., `myVariable`, `userName`). This convention is often used for naming functions and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **UPPER_CASE**: Use all uppercase letters with underscores to denote constants (e.g., `MAX_VALUE`, `PI`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Single Underscore Prefix**: Use a single underscore prefix (e.g., `_internal_var`) to indicate that a variable or function is intended for internal use within a module and should not be accessed directly from outside the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Double Underscore Prefix**: Use a double underscore prefix (e.g., `__private_var`) to invoke name mangling, making it harder to accidentally override attributes in subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these naming conventions, Python code becomes more consistent and easier to understand, promoting better code readability and maintainability."

    "Answer: The `def` keyword in Python is used to define and create functions. It is used to declare a user-defined function, allowing you to encapsulate a block of code with a name and parameters so that you can reuse it throughout your program. Functions are a fundamental building block in Python for organizing and structuring code."

    "\n",
    "Answer: The special character `\\` in Python is used as an escape character. It is used to escape or indicate that the character following it should be treated specially. For example:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- `\\n`: Represents a newline character.\r\n",
    "- `\\t`: Represents a tab character.\r\n",
    "- `\\\\`: Represents a literal backslash character.\r\n",

    "- `\\uXXXX` and `\\UXXXXXXXX`: Represent Unicode characters using their hexadecimal code points.\r\n",
