    "## Question1. What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "## Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to organize code in a way that models real-world entities and their interactions. OOP focuses on the use of objects that contain both data and methods to manipulate that data. The four main principles of OOP are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: It is the concept of bundling the data (variables) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (an object).\n",
    "2. Abstraction: It involves showing only essential features of an object and hiding the unnecessary information.\n",
    "3. Inheritance: It allows new classes to be based on existing classes, inheriting their properties and behavior.\n",
    "4. Polymorphism: It enables different objects to be treated as instances of a common class but with unique behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's demonstrate these principles with a simple Python example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating a class 'Car' to represent real-world entities\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    # Constructor to initialize object properties\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "        self.year = year\n",
    "        self.speed = 0  # Default speed\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Method to increase speed\n",
    "    def accelerate(self, increment):\n",
    "        self.speed += increment\n",
    "        print(f\"The {self.make} {self.model} is now going at {self.speed} mph.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Method to brake\n",
    "    def brake(self, decrement):\n",
    "        self.speed -= decrement\n",
    "        print(f\"The {self.make} {self.model} slowed down to {self.speed} mph.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance of the 'Car' class\n",
    "my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", 2022)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the methods of the 'Car' class\n",
    "my_car.accelerate(30)\n",
    "my_car.brake(10)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- The `Car` class represents a car and encapsulates its properties (make, model, year, speed) and methods (accelerate, brake) into a single unit.\n",
    "- `__init__` is the constructor method that initializes the object's properties when an instance of the class is created.\n",
    "- `accelerate` and `brake` are methods that operate on the 'Car' object's speed property.\n",
    "- `my_car` is an instance of the 'Car' class, representing a specific car with the make \"Toyota\", model \"Corolla\", and year 2022.\n",
    "- The code demonstrates how to use the methods of the 'Car' class to accelerate and brake the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code showcases encapsulation by bundling data and methods into a single 'Car' object, providing a basic example of OOP principles in action."

    "- Instance variables are unique to each instance of the class.\r\n",
